Increase or decrease a Roman number found under the cursor, with [count].
If a decimal number is found it is converted into its corresponding Roman
number, ignoring the [count].  Any other word is converted to the Roman
number that [count] corresponds to.

Range: I .. MMMCMXCIX (1..3999)
Higher numbers result in more than three "M"s.

There are interface mappings: <plug>IncRoman and <plug>DecRoman .
They can be mapped globally or local to buffer, the latter is the default.
From the script:
    nmap <unique><buffer> <C-A> <plug>IncRoman
    nmap <unique><buffer> <C-X> <plug>DecRoman

Therefore if you want to use the script as a plugin, you should define
global keys in your .vimrc:
    nmap <C-A> <plug>IncRoman
    nmap <C-X> <plug>DecRoman

Other scripts with support for Roman numbers:
vimscript #197 genutils : General utility functions
    genutils#Roman2Decimal(str)
vimscript #431 VimFootnotes : Insert various types of footnotes
vimscript #670 VisIncr : Produce increasing/decreasing columns of numbers, dates, or daynames
vimscript #2120 speeddating.vim : Use CTRL-A/X to increment dates, times, and more
